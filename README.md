# AWS Cloud Cost Optimization - Identifying Stale Resources
<h2>Identifying Stale EBS Snapshots</h2>
<h4>In this example, we'll create a Lambda function that identifies EBS snapshots that are no longer associated with any active EC2 instance and deletes them to save on storage costs.</h4>
<h2>Description:</h2>
<h4>The Lambda function fetches all EBS snapshots owned by the same account ('self') and also retrieves a list of active EC2 instances (running and stopped). For each snapshot, it checks if the associated volume (if exists) is not associated with any active instance. If it finds a stale snapshot, it deletes it, effectively optimizing storage costs.</h4>

<h2>WORK</h2>
<h3>Define Project Objectives:</h3> <h4> Clearly outline the goals of the cost optimization project, such as reducing infrastructure costs, improving performance, or increasing scalability.</h4>
<h3>Analyze Current Costs:</h3> <h4>Conduct a thorough analysis of current AWS usage and associated costs using AWS Cost Explorer or similar tools to identify areas for optimization.</h4>
<h3>Identify Opportunities for Serverless Migration:</h3> <h4>Determine which workloads or components of the infrastructure can be migrated to serverless architecture, focusing on Lambda functions for event-driven processing.</h4>
<h3>Design Serverless Architecture:</h3> <h4>Design a serverless architecture leveraging AWS Lambda functions and other serverless services such as API Gateway, S3, DynamoDB, etc., to replace traditional infrastructure components.</h4>
<h3>Implement Lambda Functions:</h3> <h4>Develop and deploy Lambda functions to handle specific tasks or events within the application, such as data processing, file handling, or API requests.</h4>
<h3>Utilize Triggers and Event Sources:</h3> <h4>Configure triggers and event sources to invoke Lambda functions automatically based on events such as file uploads, API requests, database changes, or scheduled tasks.</h4>
